# Description

Sekai News is an app which i can proudly say is completed but is still undergoing some UI and functional changes.
Though this was intended to be a test project, it will still get certain upgrades. This app fetches news from an API that as well fetches news from various blogs and sites and then summarise it so as to make reading more pleasant. 
And if you're wondering were the name 'Sekai' cames from, you guessed right. Its from Japan. And it means the world.
